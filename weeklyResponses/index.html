          <p>"No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.” This quote by Socrates speaks about how humans should work their hardest to reach their potential. In the context of Socrates, it was in a physical activity manner. But the e quote for me goes beyond that. The goal in life for me is to reach my full potential and excel at what we do. There is nothing worse than half doing things because the literal goal in life is personal development. As I always have to be increasing my value. Either it is with sports, academia, personal growth etc. </p>

            <p>In the article, the rise of crowdsourcing by Jeff howe speaks about how regular people on the internet can be a big role in someone’s project or company by simply just being connected to the network. It brings many scientific examples like how someone from their garage found a chemical solution for Colgate-Palmolive. But hence the article was written in 2006, crowdsourcing has changed the way we live completely. Instead of booking a hotel, we use Airbnb, instead of taking a taxi we take Ubers and instead of renting a car from car rental companies we use Turo and many more user-generated websites. All these examples fall under the term crowdsourcing. Users put their properties into use in exchange for money when they are not in use. That way of living has a lot of advantages for all three parties of the transaction, the company, the user, and the provider. But it also comes with its own disadvantages which might get a little bit immoral. A service like amazon.com where they exploit their employees is an example of that. Amazon’s reputation when it comes to treating their employees is very bad and get paid almost nothing for one of the biggest companies in the world. An example of crowdsourcing that i found very interesting is the project 10,000 cents by the digital artist Aaron Koblin with Takashi wakashima. Without being aware of the larger task, thousands of people working separately painted a little portion of a 100$ bill. Through Amazon's Mechanical Turk distributed labour tool, each worker received one cent. The bill, the artwork, and everything invlolved all required a total of $100 in labour. The project is meant to explore crowdsourcing but i looked at it from another perspective. How thousand people got paid a cent to make a 100$ bill. Just like how amazon employees get paid close to nothing to make the company’s owner the rich man he is. Though a service like amazon make our lives way easier and is extremely convenient, there should be fairness. And that is what scares me about crowdsourcing.</p>

          <p>Intro: “ If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will. " Mother Teresa's words encapsulate a potent and profoundly uncomfortable truth about human nature: most people are kind and will go to tremendous lengths to protect "the one" whose desperate situation comes to their attention. However, these same people frequently lose all empathy for "the one," who is merely one victim of a much bigger issue.</p>

       <p>After extensive research on a project that interests me in visualizing data in an interesting experimental way, to compare it with we feel fine; I found “Biocontrol” simulation. The purpose of this comic was to "invisibilize" the data so that the audience wouldn't even be aware that it was being displayed to them. Many lines of code work behind the scenes to determine how likely it is that a component of the digital plant will be attacked by the digital wasps. These calculations are based only on the data, taking into account the age, species, and number of galls that were developed on the plant throughout the experiment.
 With this type of data visualization, the viewer is effectively introduced to a manageable amount of data while also having the opportunity to formulate their own questions about what they are seeing and (hopefully) seek to have them answered through careful observation or by speaking with a subject matter expert.

 <p>The project is part of a bigger research by fine arts students in 2014. The question that was being tried to answer is: How do Differences in Growth Between Two Weed Species Affect Interactions with a Plant-Feeding Insect Used in their Biocontrol?
The study's director, Doctor Rose, gave the students the raw data from an experiment conducted in a greenhouse to examine the interactions between two host weed species of this biocontrol insect, "mouse ear" and "whiplash" hawkweeds, and a gall-forming, plant-feeding wasp (Aulacidea subterminalis). The objectives of the experiment were to:
·         Is there a difference in how the two hawkweed species grow and develop as plants age?

·         If yes, do species-based differences in growth and development affect plant-gall wasp interactions?

·         What do the differences tell us about the potential efficacy of the gall wasp as a biocontrol agent of these weed species?

These questions came from data visiulasation. Which kinds of similar to the questions that came up to me when i used we feel fine. </p>

      <p>The initial data I provided was a rubber duck and an android toy. I chose those objects because they look cute, funny and creative. They have strong colours (green and yellow) so it is easy for them to be distinguished and they are small sized so it was easy for me to carry them.

     <p>Refik Anadol is a Turkish artist, explorer, researcher, and creative mind. Those are the words I decided to describe him with after watching his Merging Minds: Exploring Collective Forms of Intelligence - Space in the mind of the machine. Refik Speaks on his experiments by working with a dataset collected from the brain and the collaborations he did throughout this project. It was really interesting to see how he was speaking about it and talking about his creative journey. I also enjoyed the visuals he used in his video, they were making understanding what he was talking about way easier and comprehensible. One of my favourite topics that he spoke about is Machine Hallucinations. I think they are extremely interesting and it is what I liked the most about mixing AI with arts.
